# Cost-Sensitive-Binary-Classification

This repo is for the final project of Fall 2018 EECS 6690 Statistical Learning course in Columbia University, contributed by Minhui Li, Tian Xia, Yuqin Xu.<br />

reproduction.r is the code that reproduces the result of paper *Cost-Sensitive Naive Bayes Classification of Uncertain Data*.<br />
Code in folder Attribute1->9 tests the Cost-Sensitive Subset Selection Algorithm applied to basic classification algortihms.<br />
Code in folder train_alldata tests the fitting abilities of those basic classification algorithms.<br />
70+all attribute.r tests the generalization abilities of the basic algorithms.
